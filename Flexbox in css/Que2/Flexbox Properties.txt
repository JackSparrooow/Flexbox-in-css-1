Flexbox Properties:-

1) Justify-content:-The justify-content property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally).

2)align-item:- The align-items property specifies the default alignment for items inside a flexbox or grid container.
In a flexbox container, the flexbox items are aligned on the cross axis, which is vertical by default (opposite of flex-direction).
In a grid container, the grid items are aligned in the block direction. For pages in English, block direction is downward and inline direction is left to right.
For this property to have any alignment effect, the items need available space around themselves in the appropriate direction.

4)flex-direction:- The flex-direction property specifies the direction of the flexible items.
                   If the element is not a flexible item, the flex-direction property has no effect.

5)flex-wrap:- The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flexible items should wrap or not.
              If the elements are not flexible items, the flex-wrap property has no effect.
